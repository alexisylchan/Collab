                                </li>

                                    <p> PV_DISABLE_COMPOSITE_INTERRUPTS If this variable is set to 1, it is not possible to interrupt the compositing of images in parallel rendering. Otherwise it is interruptible through mouse interaction. </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p> PV_ICET_WINDOW_BORDERS Setting this variable to 1 when running ParaView in tiled display mode using IceT causes the render window for each tile to be the same size as the display area in ParaView’s main application window. (Normally each render window fills the whole screen when tiled display mode is used.) This feature is sometimes useful when debugging ParaView. </p>

                            <p>Application wide settings are saved in-between sessions so that every time you start ParaView on the same machine you get the same behaviors. The settings are stored in an XML file that resides at %APPDATA%\ParaView\ParaViewVERSION.ini on Windows and ~/.config/ParaView/ParaViewVERSION.ini on all other platforms. If you need to restore ParaView's default settings you can either move this file or run with the --disable-registry argument. </p>
                            <p>These settings are managed via the settings dialog. On Macintosh, this is reached from the Preferences entry in the ParaView menu. On Unix, Linux, and Windows systems it is reached from the Settings entry on the Edit menu. These settings are program wide and are not to be confused with the View settings found under the Edit menu. Those settings are specific to each View window and are discussed in the  Displaying Data chapter. </p>
                            <p>The following figures show the various pages within the settings dialog. Choose from among them by clicking on the page list toward the left. Click on the arrow to expose the three sub pages in the Render View settings category. Some plugins add their own pages to the dialog but we do not discuss them here and instead refer you to any documentation that comes along with the plugin. Do note though that most settings are documented within the application via tool tips. </p>

                            <p>When setting up visualizations, most datasets in the visualization are typically colored using scalar colors. However, there may be items in the setup that are simply colored using a  solid color including text and other annotations. Also by default ParaView uses a grey background, so the default colors chosen for objects tends to be setup so that it looks appropriate on the grey background. However, when saving a screenshot for printing, you may prefer to white background, for example. In that case, it can be tedious to go to every object and change its color to work with the new background color. </p>
                            <p>To make it easier to change colors on the fly, ParaView defines color categories. Users can choose to assign a color category to any object when specifying a color using the category menu on most color-chooser buttons, as shown below. </p>

                            <p>These settings control how and where rendering happens when you are connected to a remote server.  </p>
                            <p>The Remote Rendering Parameters are controls that generally affect the break-up of rendering work between the remote server and the local client machine. </p>

                                        <strong>Remote Render Theshold</strong>: Geometry that is smaller than the set value will be delivered to the client for local rendering. Data that is larger than the set value will be rendered remotely and pixels will be sent instead.</p>

                                        <strong>Client Outline Threshold</strong>: While the camera is being manipulated and the geometry is being rendered locally, or in tiled display mode when it is being rendered both locally and remotely, data that is larger than this threshold will be rendered as a bounding box to maintain interactivity</p>
                                </li>

                                        <strong>Suppress Ordered Compositing</strong>: This setting turns of the relatively slow transfer of data that must happen in parallel in order to render translucent geometry (as in volume rendering for instance) correctly.</p>

                            <p>The Client/Server Parameters section has controls that affect how pixels are transferred between the render server and the client while the data is being rendered remotely and images rather than geometry are being delivered to the client. The Apply presets for ... menu allows you to choose from a set of default settings which are generally well-suited to particular network connection bandwidths. </p>

                                        <strong>Interactive Subsample Rate</strong>: This setting controls how coarsely the image is down sampled to maintain interactivity while the camera is being manipulated.</p>

                                        <strong>Image Compression</strong>: Enables compression of images during interaction. You can choose from either of the two image compression algorithms:</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                                        <strong>Squirt</strong>: Chooses IceT's native squirt image compression algorithm. The slider to the right controls the colorspace fidelity of the compression and conversely the interactive responsiveness.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                                        <strong>Zlib</strong>: Chooses the ZLib library's compression algorithm instead. The spin box to the right specifies a compression level (1 through 9). The slider controls the colorspace fidelity. The Strip Alpha checkbox removes the Opacity channel (if any) from the shipped images.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The Tile Display Parameters section contains controls that take effect when doing tiled display wall rendering. </p>
                            <ul>

                                        <strong>Still Subsample Rate</strong>: This puts a screen space coarseness limit on the normally full-resolution rendering that happens once you release the mouse after moving the camera. Image compositing time can prevent interactivity when working with large displays. This limit allows you to preview your results quickly and then choose to render truly full-resolution results only once when you are satisfied with the preview.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                                        <strong>Compositing Threshold</strong>: This threshold allows you to get faster rendering times in the circumstance that you are visualizing relatively small datasets on large tiled displays. When the geometry size is below the threshold, the geometry is broadcast to all nodes in the render server. After this broadcast, the relatively slow tiled image compositing algorithm is entirely omitted.</p>
